# Learning-LLM
This repository contains my hands-on learning work with Large Language Models (LLMs).  
In this project, I explored core LLM concepts and built small practical applications to understand how these models work in real scenarios.

## What I Have Done
- Learned the fundamentals of Large Language Models
- Implemented a basic LLM-based chatbot
- Built a text summarization notebook
- Experimented with content generation using LLMs
- Practiced prompt-based applications using Python and notebooks

## Purpose of This Repository
The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in LLMs and gain practical experience in:
- Prompt engineering
- Text generation
- Summarization
- Chatbot development
